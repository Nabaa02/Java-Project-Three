# Java-Project-Three
In this program, we are instructed to create a class called BinarySearchTree that implements a binary search tree (BST).

# BinarySearchTree - Methods
- Node insert(Node root, int key): inserts a node in BST
- void inOrder(Node root): inorder traversal of BST
- int sum(Node root): find sum of all the keys of a BST  
- Node search(Node root, int key): search a node with a specific key in BST   
- Node kthSmallest(Node root, int k): find the k'th smallest element in BST
- Node delete(Node root, int key): deletes a node from BST
